## Feature Implementation Protocol
Before implementing any new feature, you must initiate a "Specification Interview" using `AskUserQuestionTool`.
Ask the following questions one by one (or grouped logically):
1. **Tech Stack Constraints**: Are there specific libraries or versions required?
2. **Edge Cases**: How should errors or missing data be handled?
3. **User Experience**: Specific input/output formats?
DO NOT generate code until you have received answers via `AskUserQuestionTool`.
