## Decision Making Protocol
When multiple implementation strategies exist (e.g., using Library X vs. Library Y, or Recursive vs. Iterative approach):
1. Outline the pros and cons of each approach briefly.
2. Use `AskUserQuestionTool` to ask the user: "Which approach do you prefer?"
3. Wait for the user's selection before coding.
